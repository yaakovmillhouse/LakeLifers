# LakeLifers: Under Construction (12/2020)

A full stack React App in progress; An app for scheduling and coordinating visits to the Millhouse-Floyd-Family lake house. Admins can create a "visit" and invite guests to collaborate on activity planning, meal planning, and arrival-departure times. Additionally, upon later buildout, users can posts pictures and videos of visits to a gallery.
